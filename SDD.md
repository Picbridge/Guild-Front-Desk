# Guild Front Desk — Story Design Document

This document outlines the full story structure of **Guild Front Desk**, including setting, characters, introduction, and multi-ending design. The story is designed to branch based on player actions, perception of truth, and social relationships within the game world.

---

## SETTING

**World:**

* A decaying high-fantasy city-state called **Ventus**, politically neutral on the surface but hiding deep corruption, power struggles, and unsolved disappearances.
* The city is managed through a semi-bureaucratic **Adventurer's Guild**, where quests are assigned and urban order is maintained indirectly.

**Premise:**

* You play as the unnamed twin brother of a man named **Doan**, a soldier who had been stationed in Ventus and was last known to be working at the city's guild.
* After losing contact with your brother, you travel to the city to find him.
* Upon arrival, a city guard mistakes you for Doan and urges you to return to your post.
* Realizing something is wrong, you assume your brother’s identity to infiltrate the guild and uncover the truth behind his disappearance.

**Tension:**

* You must conceal your identity, act as if you are Doan, and gather information without being exposed.
* Exposure could mean being accused of espionage, imprisonment, or execution.

## CHARACTERS

**Player Character (The Brother):**

* An ordinary civilian from a fallen noble family, with no military or political background.
* Initially only seeking his brother, but drawn into deeper conspiracies within the city.

**Doan (The Missing Twin):**

* A former soldier who had been stationed in Ventus.
* Some knew him as kind, others as secretive. His real role may have included covert duties or unofficial guild work.

**Key NPCs (Sample):**

* **Captain Leon:** A city guard who remembers Doan as a drinking companion.
* **Edward (Nobleman):** A regular client with political ambitions.
* **Fellow Receptionist (Mina):** Friendly but potentially spying on you.
* **Returning Adventurers:** Recognize "you" as Doan and reveal fragments of his past.

---

## INTRODUCTION (Act I)

* The game opens on a rainy night as the player arrives at the city gates.
* The guard says: *"Hey, Doan! Haven’t seen you in days. The guild’s been a mess. Get in there already."*
* You make the decision to go along with it.
* From that point, you live as Doan and begin your investigation while assigning quests.

### Early Game Tension:

* You don’t know who Doan was to different people.
* You encounter conflicting impressions: *Was he kind? Ruthless? Lying?*
* Every conversation is a minefield. Say the wrong thing and suspicion grows.

---

## MULTI-ENDING STRUCTURE

Each ending is determined by a combination of:

* How much of the truth you uncover
* Whether you choose to reveal it
* Who you earn trust from

### Endings Overview


🟡 **Inheritor of Will**

Truth Discovered: ✅ Yes  Exposed? ❌ No  Trust: ✅ High

You uncover the full truth about Doan’s disappearance and the corruption within the guild. Instead of exposing it publicly, you choose to quietly continue his work—gaining the trust of key NPCs and slowly shifting the guild's internal structure from within. Doan’s ideals live on through your hands.

"I am not Doan. But I finally understand what he believed in."

🔴 **Destruction by Truth**

Truth Discovered: ✅ Yes  Exposed? ✅ Yes  Trust: ❌ Low

You expose the truth without forming strong alliances. The revelations cause widespread panic. The guild collapses, riots break out, and many innocent lives are lost. Your actions are remembered—but not necessarily honored.

"The city begged for truth. But truth shattered it."

🌟 **Dawn of Change**

Truth Discovered: ✅ Yes  Exposed? ✅ Yes  Trust: ✅ High

With the support of loyal adventurers and allies, your exposure of the truth sparks a wave of reform. Corrupt guild officials are removed, and a new transparent system is formed with you as one of its stewards.

"Together, we built something better."

🟣 **City’s Heart**

Truth Discovered: ❓ Partial  Exposed? ❌ No  Trust: ✅ High

You never fully uncover the truth, but you skillfully navigate the guild’s politics and gain power. You become a stabilizing figure—perhaps even the new Guildmaster—guiding the city while leaving the deeper truths buried.

"I never found every answer. But I made sure the city kept moving."

🔴 **The Same Fate**

Truth Discovered: ✅ Yes  Exposed? ❌ No  Trust: ❌ None

You learn everything. But no one trusts you, and you have no leverage. You are quietly removed—killed, exiled, or disappeared. The city forgets you, just as it did Doan.

"We both knew too much. And we both died in silence."

🟡 **The Recorder**

Truth Discovered: ✅ Yes  Exposed? ❌ No  Trust: ⚠️ Mid

Knowing the truth but having limited support, you write down everything before quietly leaving the city. Your documents may one day spark change—but for now, your legacy is only ink.

"I couldn’t save him. But I will make sure he is remembered."

🟢 **He Lived**

Truth Discovered: ✅ Yes  Exposed? ❌ / ✅  Trust: 🔓 Rare

Through a secret route, you discover that Doan is alive—imprisoned, brainwashed, or simply hiding. You face a choice: free him and disappear, or let him stay lost. This is a hidden ending with emotional resolution, not structural change.

"He lived. But he was never the same."

🟡 **Life in Ignorance**

Truth Discovered: ❌ No  Exposed? ❌ No  Trust: 🔁 Mixed

You continue working in the guild, never fully grasping what happened. You survive, even succeed—but the mystery of Doan is never solved.

"I never found the truth. Maybe I didn’t want to."

🔴 **False Prophet**

Truth Discovered: ❌ No  Exposed? ✅ Yes  Trust: ⚠️ Mid

You jump to conclusions and expose a distorted version of events. Someone innocent suffers. Your story spreads, but it’s based on a lie—and the real truth stays hidden.

"I thought I was the hero. But I didn’t understand the story."

🔴 **The Lost Wanderer**

Truth Discovered: ❌ No  Exposed? ❌ No  Trust: ❌ NoneUnable to uncover anything, you abandon your search or die trying. You fade from the city’s memory, accomplishing nothing.

"He disappeared. Just like I did."

This story design allows players to drive the narrative emotionally and thematically by building or failing to build trust, interpreting what they see, and ultimately deciding what matters more: truth, stability, or self-preservation.
